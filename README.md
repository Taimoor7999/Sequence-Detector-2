# Sequence-Detector-2
Developed a Sequence Detector to detect a particular input behaviour
Design and implement a sequence detector that meets the following specifications: 
      The detector contains single input 'w' and output 'z'.  
      All changes in the circuit occur on the positive edge of a clock signal. 
      The output 'z' is equal to '1' only if input 'w' receives ‘’1’’ in 2 consecutive clock cycles. 
      If the input remains 1 then output will remain 1
